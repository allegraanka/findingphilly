Welcome to PhillyEats - Philadelphia's only food app that we've created!

PhillyEats is for all of our philly foodies (colloquially reffered to as 'phoodillies') who either want to search recipies or resturaunt. If it starts with an "re" and concerns food, we got it! User's will answer survey questions to help tailor their solutions so that we can find the right results just for you!

The goal of this app is to help people find recipies or places to eat in our beautiful city of Philadelphious.

To start just login or create a username and you can start filling out the survey questions or just jump right into a search!

If you need any assistance or have any questions please fill out a comment on our contact page and we'll pretend we know how to respond!

Happy eatings!
